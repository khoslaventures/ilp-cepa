# Onion Routing on Interledger

This is a naive implementation of onion routing over the STREAM protocol for
Interledger.

## TODOs

- [x] Get base layer STREAM running
- [ ] Write onion interactions on top of STREAM
- [ ] Write ILP interactions on top of STREAM
- [ ] Merge with ilp-connector/SPSP server (use real shared secrets and full protocol)
